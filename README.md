Portfolio of completed projects

This repository contains projects that I completed while taking The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course taught by Colt Steele. There are five projects in total that best showcase what I have learned during that course. Here are short descriptions of each project and why they were put into the repository:

<strong>Blog</strong>: This is a simple static blog page to showcase knowledge of basic HTML and CSS.

<strong>Photo Gallery</strong>: This is also a static page of HTML and CSS but it is more advanced and structured than the Blog project. It links Bootstrap, jQuery, and FontAwesome  CDNs to the HTML to make a more stylized, organized, and streamlined webpage.

<strong>Score Keeper</strong>: This is a score keeping application that exhibits knowledge of JavaScript basics and logic, as well as the basics of how JavaScript can be used with CSS and HTML.

<strong>Color Game</strong>: This is an application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a color-picking game. This is one of the most intensive projects to complete and shows a great understanding of JavaScript logic, using variables, functions, event listeners, and loops, as well as how to use JavaScript with HTML and CSS to create a dynamic and responsive application.

<strong>To Do List Project</strong>: This application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make an interactive to do list. This is another intensive project that displays my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as jQuery. This project nicely displays the sum of what I have learned in the Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy.
